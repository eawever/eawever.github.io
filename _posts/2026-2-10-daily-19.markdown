<h2>Preparing for Contribution</h2>

Today I concentrated on preparation rather than applications. I refined my understanding of how Django structures pull requests and issue discussions so that when I submit my first contribution, it meets project standards. Establishing a reliable local development workflow has reduced friction and increased my confidence in testing changes.

<h2>Strengthening AWS Cost Knowledge</h2>

I also revisited the UniversalGiving AWS listing to assess where I might need stronger hands-on examples. Since the role emphasizes cost management and monitoring, I reviewed AWS billing dashboards and cost explorer concepts within my course materials. Strengthening this area will support both certification and potential volunteer work.
