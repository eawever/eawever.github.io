<h2>SF Civic Tech Onboarding</h2>

Yesterday, on February 11, I joined a Zoom onboarding call for SF Civic Tech. The organizer introduced the structure of the community and current active projects. I expressed interest in the SafeHome project, which is building a web platform to help San Francisco residents assess earthquake risk by address. The need for a front-end developer using React and NextJS aligns well with my interest in structured, production-oriented contribution work.

<h2>SafeHome Project Alignment</h2>

SafeHome’s focus on scalability, performance, and integration with mapping tools makes it a technically meaningful civic project. The role involves collaboration with designers and backend developers, code reviews, and architectural input, which would provide structured experience similar to what I valued in my OpenStack mentorship.

<h2>Continued Technical Development</h2>

I am continuing to maintain my Django development setup and monitor beginner-friendly issues so that I can begin contributing soon. At the same time, I am keeping pace with my AWS Solutions Architect review, reinforcing storage, DNS routing, and S3 security principles. Balancing certification preparation with active community involvement remains a central focus.
