<h2>Narrowing Down Idealist Opportunities</h2>

Today I focused on narrowing down which Idealist opportunities I may pursue actively. The UniversalGiving AWS role remains the most aligned with my current technical direction, particularly as I prepare for certification. The responsibility to evaluate AWS accounts for cost efficiency mirrors many of the cost optimization case studies in my coursework.

I also revisited the Fullstack and Mobile Developer listing to evaluate feasibility. The stack includes technologies I would need to ramp up on quickly, but the opportunity to work on an education-focused platform is compelling. The VEX Robotics competition volunteer role is still appealing as a shorter-term engagement that could expand my local network.

<h2>Django Contribution Review and AWS Security Study</h2>

In addition, I continued working within my Django development environment. I ran additional tests, reviewed documentation on contributing guidelines, and examined how pull requests are structured. I kept up with my AWS course as well, reviewing S3 security practices including bucket policies and IAM controls.
