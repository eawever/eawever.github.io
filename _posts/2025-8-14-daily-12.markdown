<h2>Picking Back Up</h2>

It’s been a while since my last post—not because I’ve stopped making progress, but because life and projects have been moving quickly. This isn’t a “fresh start” so much as a continuation of the path I was already on. In the time since my last update, I’ve made steady progress on my goals, the biggest milestone being that I’ve officially earned my **AWS Cloud Practitioner certification**. That’s one big checkbox ticked off my list and a great foundation to build on for more advanced certifications in the AWS ecosystem.

<h2>Blogging the Transition</h2>

I’m picking the blog back up as a way to keep myself accountable while I move through this transitional period—wrapping up my **Computing Technologies degree**, relocating to the SF Bay Area to help care for my family, and pushing forward with job searching and skill building. Writing about the process makes it easier to reflect on what’s working, where I’m making progress, and where I need to adjust my approach.

<h2>Focusing on Cloud Skills</h2>

The AWS Cloud Practitioner cert was just the first step. I’m now looking toward more specialized certifications and projects that demonstrate cloud skills in action. My aim is to keep a balance between studying, hands-on building, and applying for roles where these skills are relevant. Cloud infrastructure, DevOps workflows, and serverless solutions are all areas I want to strengthen as I go.

<h2>Tracking Job Applications</h2>

One of the systems I’ve set up during this time is a **spreadsheet of every position I’ve applied to**. It tracks the company, role, date applied, status, and any follow-ups. This helps prevent duplicate applications and gives me a clear picture of my outreach efforts over time. It also serves as a personal database of contacts and application history that I can refer back to.

<h2>Daily Job Search Workflow</h2>

Alongside that, I’ve built a **daily job search checklist**, a spreadsheet that lists every site I want to check for openings each day. This includes job boards, company career pages, and niche industry sites. Running through the list each morning keeps the search consistent and ensures I’m not missing any opportunities.

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

From here, the plan is to continue balancing **job applications, cloud skill building, and AWS-related projects**, while using this blog to capture the journey. The lapse in posts doesn’t mean the work stopped—it just means I have more progress to share now. Next up, I’ll be documenting some of the AWS projects I’m planning so I can both reinforce what I’ve learned and showcase it on my GitHub.
