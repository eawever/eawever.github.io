<h2>Laying the Groundwork</h2>

Today, I spent some time working on an API for managing music ratings, inspired by platforms like Rate Your Music. The plan is to design it with OpenAPI in a design-first approach and build it in Go using its standard library. The API will handle CRUD operations for albums and user ratings, calculate averages (both simple and weighted), and provide metadata like the total number of ratings. Drafting the OpenAPI spec was trickier than I expected—figuring out how to clearly define endpoints for weighted averages without overcomplicating things took some effort.

Here's a link to it:

<h2>What’s Next?</h2>

Next up, I’ll refine the OpenAPI spec. I want to make sure the API is not just functional but easy to understand and maintain. Writing handlers for CRUD operations and making sure the endpoints align with the spec has been satisfying, even if the process has been slower than I’d hoped. Overall, it’s been a mix of solving problems and learning more about Go’s way of doing things.

Tomorrow, I'm going to relax and also look at some game modding. If I end up working on that, there'll be a post for it.
