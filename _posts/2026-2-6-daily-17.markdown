<h2>Evaluating the AWS Pro Bono Role</h2>

Today I spent more time evaluating the Idealist opportunities I bookmarked. I carefully reviewed the UniversalGiving AWS Engineer role again, focusing on the cost optimization and performance analysis requirements. Given my AWS coursework and infrastructure background from OpenStack, this position seems like a practical way to apply exam concepts to a real-world environment.

<h2>Fullstack and Robotics Opportunities</h2>

I also analyzed the Fullstack and Mobile Developer opportunity more deeply. The use of Golang with Gin and GraphQL caught my attention, especially since I recently worked with RESTful APIs. Even though I do not yet have professional Kotlin or Swift experience, the backend architecture and containerization requirements overlap with skills I want to strengthen.

The VEX Robotics volunteer opportunity remains on my list because it offers local engagement and exposure to youth-focused STEM initiatives.

<h2>Technical Preparation and AWS Study</h2>

On the technical side, I continued configuring my Django development setup. I began exploring smaller documentation-related issues labeled as beginner-friendly to understand contribution expectations. I also maintained steady progress in my AWS Solutions Architect course, reviewing Route 53 routing policies and high-availability patterns.
